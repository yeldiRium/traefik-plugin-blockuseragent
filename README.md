# Block User-Agent

This repo is a fork of [agence-gaya/traefik-plugin-blockuseragent](https://github.com/agence-gaya/traefik-plugin-blockuseragent) with some changes.

Block User-Agent is a middleware plugin for [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) which sends an HTTP `403 Forbidden` 
response when the requested HTTP User-Agent header matches one the configured [regular expressions](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

## Configuration

## StaticUpdate 

```toml
[experimental.plugins.blockuseragent]
    modulename = "github.com/yeldirium/traefik-plugin-blockuseragent"
    version = "vX.Y.Z"
```

## Dynamic

To configure the `Block User-Agent` plugin you should create a [middleware](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/) in 
your dynamic configuration as explained [here](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/). The following example creates
and uses the `blockuseragent` middleware plugin to block all HTTP requests with a User-Agent like `\bTheAgent\b`.
You can use regexAllow to make exception on blocking regex.

```toml
[http.routers]
  [http.routers.my-router]
    rule = "Host(`localhost`)"
    middlewares = ["block-foo"]
    service = "my-service"

# Block all user agent containing TheAgent except if containing Allowed word
[http.middlewares]
  [http.middlewares.block-foo.plugin.blockuseragent]
    regexAllow = ["\bAllowed\b"]    
    regex = ["\bTheAgent\b"]

[http.services]
  [http.services.my-service]
    [http.services.my-service.loadBalancer]
      [[http.services.my-service.loadBalancer.servers]]
        url = "http://127.0.0.1"
```

## Omit logs for blocked requests

By default, this plugin logs each blocked request.
To prevent this, you can set the `quiet` configuration parameter:

```toml
[http.middlewares]
  [http.middlewares.block-foo.plugin.blockuseragent]
    quiet = true
```

## Manual testing

To manually test the current state of the plugin, you can start traefik using the included [compose file](./compose.yaml).
*Beware that this mounts the docker daemon socket* and uses it to configure traefik via docker labels.
The current configuration blocks requests whose useragent includes the string `blockthis`.
To test this, use e.g. curl:

```bash
curl --header "User-Agent: blockthis" -i http://localhost/
```
